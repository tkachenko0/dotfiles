Dotfiles are managed in ~/dev/personal/dotfiles repository
Configuration files in home directory (~/.zshrc, ~/.tmux.conf, ~/.gitconfig, etc.) are symlinks to files in the repository
Always check ~/dev/personal/dotfiles/modules/ for the actual configuration files
Don't try to read/modify files directly in home directory, use the repository source files instead
